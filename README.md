# Epuls

I created the ePuls application inspired by my childhood memories. It replicates the functionality of the former website epuls.py.
Unfortunately, I was unable to finish this project due to lack of time.

## About epuls
ePuls is a social media application similar to LinkedIn. Its primary audience consists of users looking to engage and manage their profiles actively.
Users can create, search, and manage their accounts. The application allows users to perform various actions such as creating guestbook entries, adding comments, updating profiles, and more. ePuls also integrates a scoring system where users earn points for different activities.

## Features of Application
* User Activity Management: Creation, browsing, and management of user actions.
* Activity Points: Users receive points for various actions.
* Notifications: Automatic notification sending.
